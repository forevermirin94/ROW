![Alt text](https://image.ibb.co/jLJAOk/robot.jpg "Optional title")

The robot is controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3B. The onboard wifi chip is used to create an access point in order to connect to the Raspberry Pi wirelessly. There is a camera on the robot that is connected to the CSI port of Raspberry Pi that is used stream video to the user. On the I2C bus there is a distance sensor and a compass to give information about the robot’s surroundings and orientation. The distance sensor uses ultrasound to detect objects in front of it and the compass uses the earth’s magnetic field to calculate the orientation of the robot. The distance sensor is mounted on top of a servo of which the position can be set with PWM. Also connected to the I2C bus is the motor controller. The motor controller has two channels. The two left motors are both connected to one channel and the two right motors are connected to the other channel. The controller sends a PWM signal to the motors to control their speed. Connected to one of the wheels is a rotary sensor. This sensor sends a pulse to the Raspberry Pi when the wheel is spinning.
